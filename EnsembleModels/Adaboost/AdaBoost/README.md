To make a prediction, Adaboost starts building a short tree
called a stump from the training data.
The amount of say that the stump has on the final output is based on how well it compensated for those previous errors.
Adaboost builds the next stump based on errors that the previous stump made.
If it did a poor job, this will be reflected in the tree's size, it will have a reduced amount of say.
